\title{BDL Assignment 5: Tracking Model Building Experiments with MLFlow}
\author{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section*{Description}

The assignment aims to build several neural network models for MNIST digit classification with different model configuration settings. Each configuration setting will show different patterns in model building performance measurements over every learning epoch. The goal is to compare the model performance trends and understand the impact of model configuration settings.

Instead of manually coding for data collection and visualization, MLFlow automatically tracks the metrics and parameters during the model-building process.

\section*{Files}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{A05-Tracking a Model building experiment in MLFlow.pdf}: This file contains the assignment instructions and tasks.
    \item \texttt{MM20B007 BDL Assignment 5.pdf}: This file contains the Jupyter Notebook code for building the classification models with different parameter settings and logging the experiments using MLFlow.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Tasks}

The main tasks of the assignment are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Modify the code to log metrics (loss, accuracy) using \texttt{mlflow. autolog()} and \texttt{mlflow.log\_metrics()}.
    \item Modify the code to log parameters (network configuration, learning rate, optimizer, regularization, etc.) using \texttt{mlflow.autolog()} and \texttt{mlflow.log\_param()}.
    \item Use the \texttt{with mlflow.start\_run()} construct to run the model build for each configuration, creating a new entry in MLflow for each run.
    \item Configure the entire MNIST experiment as an experiment, with each neural configuration becoming a sub-experiment.
    \item Visualize and compare the performance numbers using the "Compare" button in the MLflow UI, taking snapshots of the comparison plots.
    \item Compare models across experiments and take snapshots of the plots.
\end{enumerate}
